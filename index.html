            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>
                I’m a Computer Science student at ENSEEIHT, driven by the intersection of data, strategy, and high-speed performance. My goal is to apply my skills in data analysis and AI to one of the most demanding and interesting environments I know of : competitive motorsport.
            </p>
            <p>
                This portfolio follows my journey — from experimenting with reinforcement learning models to preparing an international mobility project that connects with my goals as an engineer.

            <h3>Project: Reinforcement Learning AI for "Snake"</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Context:</strong> As a personal side project, I trained a simple AI agent to play and master the classic game “Snake.”</li>
                <li><strong>My Role:</strong> I started from a given model from a tutorial but focused on the real engineering challenge: <em>configuring, training, and tuning the model</em> rather than rewriting it from scratch.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Learnings & Reflection:</strong> I managed several training cycles, tested different parameters, and studied how each configuration affected the performance. This experience strengthened my interest not only in AI theory but also in the process of improving a system.</li>

        <h2>International Mobility</h2>
        
        <div class="card hidden">
            <h3>Mobility Goals: Ireland & The Netherlands would be my first choice</h3>
            <p>I aim to study in a major European tech hub to develop my skills. After reviewing the available agreements, there seems to be good opportunities for my field in <strong>Ireland</strong> and <strong>The Netherlands</strong>.</p>
            <p>The most suitable options are through <strong>"Free Mover"</strong> or <strong>"Paying Agreement"</strong> programs to get a master in my third year in one of those universities. Moreover, I really appreciate those countries and the opportunites that I could get by studying in another country for a whole year.</p>

            <hr style="border-color: var(--border-color); margin: 20px 0;">

            <h3>Project 1: TU Delft (Netherlands)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Why:</strong> TU Delft, available as a “Free Mover” destination, is world-class in engineering, applied mathematics, and AI. I would target their <em>Computer Science & Engineering</em> or <em>Applied Mathematics</em> departments, both completly aligned with my goals.
            </p>

            <h3>Project 2: Dublin City University (Ireland)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Why:</strong> DCU is listed with a <em>Paying Agreement</em> that covers all departments. Its School of Computing is particularly strong in Data Science and AI which is an ideal match for the kind of applied and data-driven work I aim to pursue.
            </p>

            <h3>Project 3: University College Cork (Ireland)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Why:</strong> UCC, also a “Free Mover” option, has a highly regarded School of Computer Science and Information Technology. Their research in AI and data analytics provides another relevant option for my mobility project.

            <h3>My Engagement Plan: Volunteer Track Marshal</h3>
            <p>
                For my 40-hour engagement project, I plan to train and volunteer as a <strong>track marshal</strong> during motorsport events.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> It combines my passion for motorsports with a desire to contribute meaningfully by ensuring the safety of the drivers and anyone around the track.</li>
                <li><strong>Skills:</strong> The role requires responsibility, quick decision-making under pressure, and teamwork which are soft skills that are key to engineering work.</li>
                <li><strong>Next Step:</strong> I’m currently reaching out to organizations like the FFSA to learn more about the certification process and confirm this plan with the Soft Skills Center.</li>

                <h3>My Aligned International Mobility Projects</h3>
                <p>My mobility plan is designed to acquire the specific skills demonstrated by my role models.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Project 1: TU Delft (Netherlands) - "Free Mover"</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Focus:</strong> Applied Mathematics, AI & Simulation Engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> This project aligns perfectly with "Jude Hunt" and "Bastien Clergue". TU Delft is world-class in engineering, simulation, and applied AI. This experience would provide the deep technical skills in modeling and complex systems needed to become a "Vehicle Performance Engineer" or a "Control System Engineer".
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Project 2: Dublin City University (Ireland) - "Paying Agreement"</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Focus:</strong> School of Computing (Data Science, AI).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> This project aligns directly with "Hannah Schmitz". Dublin is a "Big Data" hub (home to Microsoft, AWS, Google). An exchange at DCU would provide cutting-edge skills in cloud computing and real-time data pipeline management—competencies that are directly transferable to the high-pressure "Operations Room" environment.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Project 3: University College Cork (Ireland) - "Free Mover"</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Focus:</strong> School of Computer Science (AI, Data Analytics).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> This is a strong alternative for the "Hannah Schmitz" path. UCC's research in AI and data analytics provides another excellent pathway to gain the "Big Data" skills required in the Irish tech hub, with the same goal of translating them to the motorsport industry.
