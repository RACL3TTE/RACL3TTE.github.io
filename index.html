                    <li><strong>My Role:</strong> I based my work on an existing model from a tutorial. My real focus wasn't on coding the model itself, but on the practical engineering challenge: **model configuration, training, and fine-tuning.**</li>
                    <li><strong>Key Learnings & Reflection:</strong> I managed multiple training cycles, experimented with hyperparameters, and analyzed how different settings impacted the agent's success rate. This project confirmed my interest not just in AI theory, but in the iterative, hands-on process of *making a model perform*.</li>

                <h3>My Mobility Goals: Ireland & The Netherlands</h3>
                <p>To work in data-driven fields, I'm targeting a mobility experience in a major European tech hub. My focus is on **Ireland and the Netherlands**.</p>
                <p>After analyzing the agreements, I've found the best-fit opportunities for my specialization (AI/Data) are via **'Free Mover'** or **'Accord payant'**. I'm ready to take this independent route to access top-tier institutions.</p>
                
                <hr style="border-color: var(--border-color); margin: 20px 0;">

                <h3>Project 1 (Analysis): TU Delft (Netherlands)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Alignment:</strong> The file lists an opportunity at **Technische Universiteit Delft** as a "Free Mover". TU Delft is world-class for engineering, applied mathematics, and AI. This represents the ideal technical environment, and I would independently seek out their "Computer Science & Engineering" or "Applied Mathematics" departments.
                </p>

                <h3>Project 2 (Analysis): Dublin City University (Ireland)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Alignment:</strong> DCU is listed with an **"Accord payant"** (Paying Agreement) that covers **"ts départements"** (all departments). DCU's "School of Computing" is strong in Data Science and AI, offering a direct route to the specialized courses I'm looking for.
                </p>

                <h3>Project 3 (Analysis): University College Cork (Ireland)</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Alignment:</strong> UCC is also listed as a **"Free Mover"** opportunity. Like TU Delft, this project would involve proactively applying to their renowned "School of Computer Science and Information Technology", which has active research in AI and data analytics.

                <p>My career models are people who bridge the gap between pure data and real-world, high-speed results.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Role Model 1 (The Strategist): Hannah Schmitz (Principal Strategy Engineer, Red Bull Racing)</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Analysis:</strong> She is the benchmark for data-driven strategy. Her role involves analyzing massive volumes of real-time data (telemetry, weather, tire wear) to make high-stakes decisions. She leads a team conducting live simulations from the "Operations Room" and proves the value of a calm, analytical mind under extreme pressure.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>Role Model 2 (The Data Engineer): The "Vehicle Performance Engineer" (e.g., Williams Racing)</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Analysis:</strong> This profile is more technical, focusing on car optimization. The role involves processing data from hundreds of sensors in real-time, using models (Python/MATLAB) to analyze performance, and working with race engineers to improve setups. This role is the direct link between raw data and mechanical engineering.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>
                        <strong>Role Model 3 (The Pragmatist): The N7 Alumnus Data Scientist in the Netherlands</strong>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Analysis:</strong> This is the pragmatic path. Finding an N7 engineer (via AIN7/LinkedIn) who has leveraged their dual skills to join a Dutch high-tech company (like ASML, Philips, or NXP) demonstrates a clear and proven career trajectory. It validates the plan to build industrial data skills in that specific ecosystem.

                            <strong>Focus:</strong> Applied Mathematics, Computer Science, and Engineering Systems.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Aligns perfectly with **Role Models 2 and 3**. TU Delft is world-class in engineering and simulation, providing the ideal skills to become a "Vehicle Performance Engineer". It's also the exact path taken by the "N7 Alumnus" to enter the high-tech industry in the Netherlands.

                        <p>
                            <strong>Focus:</strong> School of Computing (Data Science, AI).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> Aligns with **Role Model 1**. Dublin is a "Big Data" hub (Microsoft, AWS, Google). An exchange at DCU would provide cutting-edge skills in cloud computing and real-time data pipeline management—competencies directly transferable to the high-pressure "Operations Room" environment.
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Focus:</strong> School of Computer Science (AI, Data Analytics).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Alignment:</strong> A strong alternative to DCU for aligning with **Role Model 1**. UCC's research in AI and data analytics provides another excellent pathway to gain the "Big Data" skills required in the Irish tech hub, with the same goal of translating them to the motorsport industry.
